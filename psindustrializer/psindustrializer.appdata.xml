  <description>
    <p>
      This program generates synthesized percussion sounds using physical modelling.
      The range of sounds possible include but is not limited to cymbal sounds,
      metallic noises, bubbly sounds, and chimes. After a sound is rendered, it
      can be played and then saved to a .WAV file.
